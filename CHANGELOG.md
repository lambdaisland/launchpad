# Unreleased

## Added

- Two more JVM flags are enabled by default
  - `-J-Dclojure.main.report=stderr`: make Clojure print stacktraces
    immediately, instead of writing them to a file
  - `-J-Djdk.attach.allowAttachSelf`: enable interrupting an nREPL evaluation

# 0.43.186-alpha (2025-04-24 / 6b1ecae)

## Added

- Add `--no-prefix` or `{:launchpad/options {:prefix false}}` to hide the
  start-of-line per-process prefix in the output

## Changed

- Make initial summary print aliases with namespace.

  Before:
  ```
  Aliases: dev, cider, zprint, local
  ```
  After:
  ```
  Aliases: :dev, :home/cider, :home/zprint, :mine/local
  ```

# 0.42.182-alpha (2025-03-01 / 50cc172)

## Fixed

- Make sure CLI flags can negate options set in `.clojure/deps.edn` /
  `deps.local.edn`, e.g. `{:launchpad/options {:emacs true}}` with
  `--no-cider-connect`

# 0.41.179-alpha (2025-02-28 / d65caab)

## Fixed

- correctly handle .env / .env.local file creation and deletion 

# 0.40.174-alpha (2025-02-25 / fcc2ece)

## Fixed

- Honor aliases both from `deps.local.edn` and CLI args

# 0.39.171-alpha (2025-02-25 / 0731c0a)

## Fixed

- Bring back passing in aliases at the command line

# 0.38.168-alpha (2025-02-25 / 6f20908)

## Changed

- Upgrade dependencies

# 0.37.162-alpha (2025-02-11 / 6ec2e55)

## Fixed

- Add an `:nrepl.middleware/descriptor` to silence the warning
- Correct dotenv watch semantics. No matter the initial state we fix the behavior to achieve:

  | .env  | .env.local | Values From  |
  | ----- |----------- | ------------ |
  | ✅    | ✅         | `.env.local` |
  | ✅    | ❌         | `.env`       |
  | ❌    | ✅         | `.env.local` |
  | ❌    | ❌         | latest state |

  The last line means we currently do not keep track and therefore cannot remove already set environment variables.

# 0.36.159-alpha (2025-02-09 / eafa135)

## Added

- `--[no-]namespace-maps` option (disable `*print-namespace-maps*`)

## Changed

- Boolean flags are now defined as `--[no-]...`, so that you can override
  local/global/project defaults from the command line, e.g. `bin/launchpad
  --no-go`

# 0.27.126-alpha (2024-02-26 / 5f25d2d)

## Changed

- Merge consecutive calls to `lambdaisland.launchpad.watcher/watch!`, so it's
  easier to use from user code
- Don't show full clojure invocation by default, can be seen with `--verbose`

# 0.26.123-alpha (2024-01-29 / d471611)

## Fixed

- Allow setting options as a map (:launchpad/options) in `deps.local.edn` /
  `~/clojure/deps.edn`

# 0.24.117-alpha (2024-01-22 / 8008ab4)

  that it is available even in `start-steps`.

- Support for more fine grained step customization with `start-steps`/`end-steps`/`pre-steps`/`post-steps`

## Changed

  that clash with shadow-cljs

# 0.20.103-alpha (2024-01-10 / 1a5e504)

## Added

- Added a `:launchpad/shadow-connect-ids` option, for cases where you don't want
  to auto-connect to every build in `:launchpad/shadow-build-ids`

# 0.16.88-alpha (2023-03-08 / 67de06e)

## Changed

## Added

- Add support for top-level shadow-cljs config/builds, not only sub-project builds

## Fixed

- Better handle `:paths` in `deps.local.edn`, ensure they are picked up at boot,
  not only at first classpath reload

## Added

# 0.12.64-alpha (2022-10-26 / a4fdb16)

- Write the current classpath to `.cpcache/launchpad.cp`, for integrating third
  parties like clojure-lsp. (configure `cat .cpache/launchpad.cp` as your
  `:classpath-cmd`)
- Call `(user/go)` in a `try/catch`
- Start the watcher on a separate thread, it can take a long time to boot, and
  meanwhile we shouldn't block REPL startup.

## Fixed

- Pick up any `:deps` from `deps.local.edn` at startup, not at the first
  classpath reload
  
## Changed

- Disable directory-watcher file hashing, it gets prohibitively slow

# 0.11.59-alpha (2022-10-21 / 8454771)

## Fixed

- Fixes cljdoc build. There should be no changes to launchpad users.

# 0.9.49-alpha (2022-10-12 / d0123fe)

## Fixed

- Couple the lifetime of the Clojure process to the lifetime of launchpad, exit
  launchpad when the process dies, and kill the process when launchpad exits
